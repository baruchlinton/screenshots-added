Minor adjustments to what was already done by Djware, just to optimize unnecessary CPU usage, and I also added a function to display a temporary notification to indicate whether it is running or was already running.
This is also an experimental version, something like an alpha. I cannot guarantee that it will work on your device, nor do I take responsibility for any potential damage to your device. The use of the following program is at the user's own risk.


A special thanks for djware for the great idea of the screenshot function for the TrimUI Smart Pro. 
Many thank to Kloptops for the incredible and useful tool sdl2imgshow.
